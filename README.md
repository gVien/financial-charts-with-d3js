# financial-charts-with-d3js

## Overview

Financial charts let you view the candlestick stocks charts of any stocks such as Apple's (AAPL), Microsoft's (MSFT), or Facebook's (FB) stock charts. It is not limited to these symbols, you may search for any (US) stock symbols that you are interested in. The stock charts data are pulled from Yahoo Finance API and plotted using D3.js.

It is a simple stock chart that is built using a data visualization library, [D3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3), that I learned recently.
